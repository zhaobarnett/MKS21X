Cloning (copy a repo to your local machine):
git clone <web URL>
You do this within the directory you want to make the local repo in.

Adding:
git add <file name> 
You do this within the directory the file is in.
Function: In a nutshell, you run git add on a file when you want to include whatever changes you've made to it in your next commit snapshot. Anything you've changed that is not added will not be included

Commit:
git commit -m 'message'
You do this after adding the file.
Function: Now that you have staged the content you want to snapshot with the git add command, you run git commit to actually record the snapshot.
